# Example .finch-mcp configuration for a TypeScript project
# Place this file in your project root as .finch-mcp or .finch-mcp.yaml

dependencies:
  # Install all dependencies including devDependencies
  # This is the simplest solution for TypeScript projects
  installAll: true

# Alternative: If you want to keep the image smaller but still build TypeScript
# dependencies:
#   # Install specific build tools globally
#   preInstall:
#     - "npm install -g typescript"
#   # Then install only production dependencies
#   installCommand: "npm install --production"
